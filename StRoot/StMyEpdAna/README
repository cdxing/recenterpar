This code is for offline analysis of STAR's picoDsts

- There should be _no_ StObject-derived classes required.
- Make a directory "Classes/" and put PicoAnalyser.h,.cxx
  there.  Also in "Classes/" put the StEpdGeom and StBbcGeom
  classes, which you can cvs check out from StRoot/StEpdUtil/
  package.
- Hopefully "make" will make your .so library, and the thing
  will just work.  You might need to screw with the Makefile,
  as is often the case.
- You will need a DataFile.list, which is just a list of filenames
  of the STAR picoDsts

- The PicoAnalyzer.cxx is where you should put your analysis.
  It is a lot like a STAR "Maker."  You can define some histograms
  in the Init() method, and then do analysis and fill them in the
  Make() method, and then write them out in the Finish() method.
  This is just like a StMaker.

Some further notes

Unfortunately, STAR continues to use absurdly obsolete StThreeVectorD
class, so there is some unnatural stuff in the PicoAnalyzer class.
Sorry, it's not my fault.  Not everybody appreciates the benefit of
a "plain-root-based" way of analyzing STAR picoDsts, on a non-RCF computer.

When you fire the thing up, you will see the following
warnings.  This is to be expected and is not a problem.
